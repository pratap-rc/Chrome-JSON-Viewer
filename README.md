# JSON Beautifier Chrome Extension

This extension automatically detects and beautifies JSON content displayed in your browser tabs. It transforms raw JSON into a collapsible tree view with syntax highlighting, making JSON data easier to read and navigate.

## Features

*   **Automatic JSON Detection:** Detects JSON content within `<pre>` tags or when the page body primarily contains JSON text.
*   **Interactive Tree View:** Displays JSON objects and arrays as a collapsible tree structure with expandable/collapsible arrows.
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Color-codes different JSON elements (keys, strings, numbers, etc.) for better readability.
*   **System Theme Support:** Automatically adapts to your system's light/dark mode preference.
*   **Toggle View:** Switch between the beautified view and the original raw JSON view.
*   **Download:** Add a button to download the beautified JSON content as a `.json` file.

## Installation / Loading

Since this extension is not yet published on the Chrome Web Store, you need to load it manually in Developer Mode:

1.  **Download or Clone:** Make sure you have the extension files in a local directory.
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** Open Google Chrome, type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar, and press Enter.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch ON.
4.  **Load Unpacked:** Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.
5.  **Select Directory:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the extension files (the directory containing `manifest.json`) and click "Select".

6.  The "JSON Beautifier" extension should now appear in your list of extensions and be active.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to a web page that displays raw JSON data (e.g., an API endpoint response).
2.  If the extension successfully detects valid JSON, the page content will be automatically replaced with an interactive tree view of the JSON with syntax highlighting.
3.  Click on the arrow (â–¼) buttons next to objects and arrays to collapse or expand those sections.
4.  The extension automatically adapts to your system's light or dark mode preference.
5.  Use the "View Raw JSON" button to toggle back to the original unformatted view.
6.  Click the "Download JSON" button to download the beautified content as a `beautified.json` file.
